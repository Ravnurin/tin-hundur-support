## How We Use Your Information
- **Account Management:** Email and user ID for login and account security

- **Community Features:** Your first name, photos and messages to enable sharing with other dog owners
- **Communication:** Email for important app updates and support
- **Community Safety** - automated content moderation to detect and prevent inappropriate content using third-party AI services (AWS Rekognition for images, OpenAI for text)

## Content Moderation & Safety
To maintain a safe community environment and comply with app store guidelines, we use automated content moderation services:

### Image Content Review:
- **AWS Rekognition** analyses uploaded photos to detect inappropriate content
- Images are processed to identify violations of our community guidelines
- This processing happens automatically when you upload photos

### Text Content Review:
- **OpenAI's moderation service** analyses text content for inappropriate material
- This includes comments, moment captions, chat messages, and profile information
- Processing occurs when you submit text content to our app

**Data Processing:** These services process your content temporarily for moderation purposes only. Neither AWS nor OpenAI store your content permanently for their own purposes beyond the moderation function.

## Data Sharing
- We do not sell your personal information to third parties
- Your photos are shared with other app users as part of the community features
- Location data is only used within the app as part of in-app features, like the Map, Moments, and achievements

### We Share With:
- **Google Maps** - only your general area (city/postcode) to show you maps
- **Our database provider (MongoDB)** - to store your account safely
- **AWS Rekognition** - your uploaded images for automated safety and content moderation
- **OpenAI** - your text content (comments, messages, moment captions, profile information) for automated safety and content moderation

## Data Security
We implement appropriate security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

## Your Rights

- You can delete your account and data at any time through the app settings
- You can control location sharing in your device settings
- You can contact us to request data deletion or with questions

### Important Information About Third-Party Processing:
- When you submit content, it's processed by AWS and OpenAI for safety purposes
- You have the right to know about this processing and object to it
- If you object to automated content moderation, you can delete your account
- These services operate under strict data processing agreements
